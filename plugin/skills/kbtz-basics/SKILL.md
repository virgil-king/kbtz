| `kbtz watch [--root name]` | Launch interactive TUI |
| `kbtz wait` | Block until database changes |

## Task Naming

Task names must be **kebab-case**: lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only. Names are immutable — they cannot be changed after creation, so choose carefully.

## Session ID

Use `$KBTZ_SESSION_ID` as your assignee in all kbtz commands. This environment variable is set automatically by Claude Code.

```bash
kbtz claim my-task $KBTZ_SESSION_ID
```

## Never Release Your Own Task

**Do not use `kbtz release` on your own task.** Releasing makes the task unclaimed, which causes the workspace to spawn a new session for it — duplicating work and losing your context.

Instead:

- **Blocked or stuck?** → Ask the user for guidance.
- **Done?** → Clean up your session first (add notes capturing progress, remove temp resources, clean up worktrees), then call `kbtz done <name>`. This ends your session, so always add notes before calling it.
- **Waiting on child tasks?** → `kbtz wait` to block until the database changes, then check children's status. This does not end your session.

## Workspace sessions

When running inside `kbtz-workspace`, the workspace automatically creates
sessions for all open tasks. **Do not use `--claim` or `kbtz claim` when
creating tasks inside a workspace** — the workspace will claim and assign
sessions to new tasks automatically. Using `--claim` bypasses the workspace's
session management and creates ghost tasks that appear active without a
workspace session.

Only use `--claim` / `kbtz claim` outside of a workspace (e.g. standalone
CLI usage).

## Common Patterns

### Creating tasks

Keep descriptions to one sentence — they display in a single-line list view.
Put detailed context in a `-n` note so the task and its context are created
atomically:

```bash
kbtz add parent-task "Top-level description." -n "Detailed context, requirements, and acceptance criteria."
```

Outside a workspace, use `-c $KBTZ_SESSION_ID` to create and claim in one step:

```bash
kbtz add my-subtask "Short description." -p parent -c $KBTZ_SESSION_ID -n "Detailed context for the subtask."
```

Use `kbtz exec` when you need multiple commands in one transaction (e.g.
creating subtasks with blocking relationships):

```bash
kbtz exec <<'BATCH'
add child-one "First subtask." -p parent-task -n "Details for first subtask."
add child-two "Second subtask." -p parent-task -n "Details for second subtask."
block child-one child-two
BATCH
```

### Quoting in `kbtz exec`

`kbtz exec` uses its own quoting rules — not POSIX shell quoting.

**Double quotes** delimit strings. Inside double quotes, `\"` produces a
literal `"` and `\\` produces a literal `\`. All other characters
(including newlines) are literal.

**Single quotes and apostrophes** are ordinary characters — they do NOT
start quoted strings. `it's` and `don't` work without escaping.

**Heredocs** (`<<DELIMITER`) work like shell heredocs and are the best
way to include multi-line or complex text:

```
add my-task "Description" -n <<NOTE
Any content here — quotes, apostrophes, special characters.
No escaping needed inside a heredoc body.
NOTE
```

**Multiline double-quoted strings** are supported — a quoted string can
span multiple lines:

```
add my-task "Description" -n "First line
second line
third line"
```

**Recommendation:** For note content with any special characters, prefer
heredocs over double-quoted strings. Heredocs require no escaping at all.

Use `--paused` to create a task that shouldn't be worked on yet:

```bash
kbtz add deferred-task "Not ready yet" --paused
```

### Specifying closure conditions

When creating a task, clearly state the **closure condition** — what must happen before the task is considered done — in the description or an initial note. **Agents must never call `kbtz done` without explicit user approval.** There are two closure paths depending on the repository:

- **Repo with remote:** Create a PR, wait for CI to pass, and display the diff. Wait for the user to review. The user will either request changes or ask you to merge. Only call `kbtz done` after the user approves and the PR is merged.
- **Repo without remote:** Work in a worktree, then present the branch diff to the user. Wait for the user to review. The user will either request changes or ask you to merge to main. Only call `kbtz done` after the user approves and the branch is merged.

Examples:

```bash
kbtz add update-deps "Update outdated dependencies" -n "Close after user approves and PR is merged."
kbtz add fix-parser "Fix CSV parser edge case" -n "Close after user approves and branch is merged to main."
```

### Adding progress notes

```bash
kbtz note my-task "Investigated root cause, found X"
kbtz note my-task "Fix applied, running tests"
```

### Managing dependencies

```bash
# child-two cannot start until child-one finishes
kbtz block child-one child-two
```

**Session suspension:** When your task becomes blocked (either because you set up a blocking relationship or because another agent blocks you), your session will be suspended. A new session will be spawned when the task becomes unblocked. Before blocking your task, always:

1. Add notes capturing your current progress, decisions made, and enough context for a fresh session to resume the work.
2. Clean up running processes, temp files, or other resources.

```bash
kbtz note my-task "Progress: implemented X, Y remains. Next step: finish Y after blocker resolves."
kbtz block blocker-task my-task
```

### Viewing task tree

```bash
kbtz list --tree          # open tasks in tree form
kbtz list --tree --all    # include completed tasks
```

### Listing direct children

```bash
kbtz list --children my-task        # direct children only (depth 1)
kbtz list --children my-task --all  # include done/paused children
```

### Transferring task ownership

`steal` requires user approval before use. It atomically transfers an active task to a new assignee:

```bash
kbtz steal my-task $KBTZ_SESSION_ID
```
